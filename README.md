# 👋 Hey, I'm Guru Charan

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a Recent Graduate B.Tech Computer Science student from Hyderabad** , is intrested turning real-world ideas into working AI systems.

I’m passionate about **machine learning, NLP, and GenAI**, and I enjoy exploring how language models can do much more than just chat — like analyzing resumes, matching fuzzy names, or predicting drug interactions.

## 🧰 What I work with

- **ML & GenAI stack:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI & Gemini APIs
- **Data tools:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Soft skills:** Leadership, analytical thinking, team collaboration, communication

## 🌟 Projects I'm proud of

### 🧠 Fuzzy Name Matching Algorithm
An intelligent system to catch spelling mistakes, cultural name variations, and duplicates in messy datasets  
✅ Achieved ~97% accuracy combining phonetic algorithms (Soundex, Metaphone) and a Random Forest classifier  
🔗 [Check it out here](https://github.com/Gurucharan81/fuzzynamematching-using-random-forest)

---

### 💊 Drug–Drug Interaction Predictor
Built a pipeline that predicts possible side effects and interactions between drug pairs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and OCR  
✅ AUC‑ROC ~0.91, F1 score ~0.83  
🔗 [View the repo](https://github.com/Gurucharan81/drug-drug-interaction-prediction-using-gnn-and-ocr)

## 🌱 What I'm exploring right now

- Fine-tuning open-source LLMs like Flan‑T5 & Gemma
- Building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Deploying AI apps with Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces
- Designing better prompts that sound human, not robotic

---

## 📌 Why I build
For me, ML and GenAI aren’t just about code or models — they’re tools to **solve small but real problems**, like messy resumes or duplicate names in HR systems.  
I love bridging the gap between research, practical applications, and user experience.
